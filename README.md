# Advent of Code 2022

Python solutions of [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) written by [ENA](https://github.com/Enailis/)

## Requirements

The solutions were developed and tested using Python 3.10 on [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and using default python libraries.

## Disclaimer

I did this year's AoC to challenge myself on a language I didn't practice that much during my life.
I completed every challenge the day they were published. 
**The code has been refactored from day 14 to 25 to be more readable.**

## Little personal note

I never tried to play for top 100 world but eventually got top 96 world on day 17 which is pretty cool.

My ranking for both parts of each day can be seen in the table below.

This has been a really good learning experience and I can't wait for next year's AoC! Maybe I'll get another top 100 world :D
