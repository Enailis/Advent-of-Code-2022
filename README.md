# Advent of Code 2022

Python solutions of [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) written by [ENA](https://github.com/Enailis/Advent-of-Code-2022)

## Requirements

The solutions were developed and tested using Python 3.10 on [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and using default python libraries.

## Disclaimer

I do not consider myself a good python dev. I did this year's AoC to challenge myself on a language I didn't practice that much during my life.
I completed every challenge the day they were published.
